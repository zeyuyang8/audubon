## Set up
Download the repository to your local desktop. Edit `utils/global_const.py` to set `DATA_PATH` to the location where you store the dataset. The dataset should contain a list of JPG image files and CSV files.

The Python version is 3.8.16 and I installed required packages using the following commands.
```
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
pip3 install torch torchvision 
```

## Run
Open `solution.ipynb` and run the notebook.
